[简体中文](./README.zh.md)

Built with Tauri, Rust, and React. Lightweight, local-first, no cloud.

## Features

- Real-time pet reactions to Agent prompts, tool use, waiting, completion, and errors.
- Integrations for Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode, Cursor, Copilot CLI, Pi, and Gemini.
- Built-in pets plus import support for Codex-compatible pet packages.
- Rich pet interactions: hover, click, double-click, rapid-click petting, long-press, drag reactions, and native context menu.
- Global and per-pet sound packs for interactions and Agent states.
- Settings and tray controls for pets, Agent hooks, sounds, language, visibility, and window position.
- Local-first data model in `~/.copet`, with safe hook backups, atomic writes, and no telemetry.
- Bilingual UI (English / 简体中文).

## Customize your pet

CoPet is not limited to built-in pets. The [CoPet Skill series](./skills/README.md) helps you turn a character idea, team mascot, or personal avatar into your own desktop companion:

- [`copet-gen`](./skills/copet-gen/SKILL.md) generates and installs custom CoPet pet packages with `pet.json` and `spritesheet.webp`, so your own character can react to Agent activity.
- [`copet-sound`](./skills/copet-sound/SKILL.md) creates matching 11-clip MP3 sound packs for clicks, gestures, waiting, success, and error states.

Install CoPet Skills for Codex with either method.

From a terminal:

```bash
npx skills add ChanceYu/CoPet --skill '*' -a codex -g -y
```

Inside Codex:

```text
$skill-installer install all CoPet skills from https://github.com/ChanceYu/CoPet/tree/main/skills
```

Restart Codex if the newly installed Skills do not appear.

### macOS

Drag `CoPet.app` into `/Applications`. The build is not notarized, so run once to clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CoPet.app
```

### Windows

Windows builds are not code-signed. SmartScreen may warn on first launch — click *More info* → *Run anyway*.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with pnpm. Runs on macOS (primary), Windows, and Linux.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChanceYu/CoPet.git
cd CoPet
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev          # development
pnpm tauri:build        # production bundle
```

## Project layout

- `src-tauri/` — Rust core, agent adapters, runtime server.
- `src/` — React frontend (pet window + settings center).
- `src-tauri/assets/pets/` — built-in pet packages bundled with the app.
- `src-tauri/assets/sounds/` — built-in global sound packs bundled with the app.
- `skills/` — optional CoPet Skill docs for generating pets and 11-clip sound packs.
- `docs/architecture.md` — technical architecture and design.
- `AGENTS.md` — contributor guide and testing instructions.

## Security

- Event server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, requires a bearer token, rate-limits requests, and drops unknown payloads.
- All hook config changes are backed up before write and use atomic file ops.
- Pet and sound packages are treated as untrusted data and validated before use.
- `assetProtocol.scope` whitelists exactly which pet, sound, preview, and bundled resource directories the webview can read.
